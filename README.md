# Web-Tech-Project
Project.html is the main file... Create an images folder to add those two existing images for now and store further images in the same folder
make sure all the file names are the same as the one's i've kept so that linking them will be easier
The front end CSS part should be complete for menu, about us and serives by 4th november or 5th november
React and mongo db should be used for the sign in and sign up options which will be done after the front end is complete
